# Notes app

This is my **first** project created with Angular CLI (version 10.0.8).
There's a lot of not-the-best practices but I've learned quite a lot going through this.
After a while I started to understand the beauty of well organised Angular framework and I'm looking forward to creating something big.

## Backend

In Notes application I'm using friendly Firebase backend created by Google.
There are few simple _put_ and _get_ requests as well as the authentication module is being used.

## Build

This app is build with Angular Universal as pre-render which improves SEO a lot.

## Layout

Simple and minimalistic layout created with Bootstrap. My main focus was to learn Angular so a pack of ready to use styles was a nice help.
