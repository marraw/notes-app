# Notes-app Angular

This is my **first** project created with Angular CLI (version 10.0.8).
There's a lot of not-the-best solutions and bad practices but I've learned quite a lot going through this.
After a while I started to understand the beauty of well organised Angular framework and I'm looking forward to creating something big.

## Backend

In my application I'm using a newbie friendly Firebase backend created by Google.
There's a few simple _put_ and _get_ requests and also the authentication module is being used.

## Server

Application is deployed by myself, running on Ubuntu server using PM2, NGINX and UFW.
Thanks to Angular Universal, app is being server side rendered which has a possitive impact on SEO and performance.
